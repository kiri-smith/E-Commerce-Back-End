# e-commerce-back-end
For this project, I built off of starter code to build the back end for an e-commerce site. To do this, I configured an Express.js API and used Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database. I also needed to use Insomnia Core to display the API routes.  With this application, the user is able to create, update and delete data in the database. Please see the demo video below for an example of usage.
